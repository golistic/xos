xos - Extra Operating System Functionality
==========================================

Copyright (c) 2022, Geert JM Vanderkelen

Package `xos` extra functionality around the Go `os` package, which provides a 
platform-independent interface to operating system functionality.
It extends whatever is provided by the [standard Go library][1], contains
no magic, and probably does offer not more than what can be found in various
other projects.
